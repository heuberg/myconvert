# Welcome!
We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to **`MyConvert`**! If you're unsure about anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request.

## Conversion definitions
MyConvert depends on usable conversion defintions. Not everyone should have to write their own definition files, that's why we are collecting them :smile: If you want to share your conversion definitions with us, just send them by [email](mailto:hameau@eclipso.at) and we are happy to put them on the website. If you have translated conversions from english to your native language we would also be happy if you share them.
See [here](definitions.md) for a list of all currently available definition files.

## App translation
If you want to translate the app to your native language (or noticed incorrect spelling or wording), please let us know.
All strings used in the application can be found [here](../app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).

## Donations
Monetary contributions are also very welcome :) Please contact us for more information.
